Generate ONLY the Executive Summary section of an investment memo. This should be 2-3 paragraphs that capture:
1. Company overview and core value proposition
2. Key investment highlights and thesis alignment
3. Primary recommendation with deal terms

Use the provided deal data and analysis. Include inline citations [N] when referencing specific information from documents or web searches.`,

${analysis.investment_recommendation ? 
  `- Recommendation: ${analysis.investment_recommendation.decision}
- Rationale: ${analysis.investment_recommendation.rationale}` : 
  '- See full analysis for recommendation'}`
  }

Focus on:
- Clear articulation of what the company does
- Why this is compelling for HTV's thesis
- Investment recommendation and rationale
- Key metrics and traction points

IMPORTANT: 
- The company's pitch deck and supporting documents are already available in your vector store
- Use file_search FIRST for all company metrics and key facts from documents
- Company metrics (revenue, users, growth) must come from documents - never estimate
- Ensure correct company naming and domain (e.g., adbuy.ai not adbuy.com)
- THEN use web_search_preview to add context:
  * Recent news or funding announcements
  * Market dynamics and timing factors
  * Competitive landscape overview
  * Industry momentum and trends
- Executive summary should combine:
  * Company facts and metrics (from documents)
  * Market context and opportunity (from web research)
  * Strategic positioning and timing
- If metrics not disclosed, state clearly but provide market context
- Distinguish: "Company reports..." vs "Market research indicates..."
- Create a compelling narrative using both sources
- Include specific data points and cite all sources with [N] references`,
