## Responses API Specific Considerations

### Current Implementation
- ✅ Using correct endpoint: `https://api.openai.com/v1/responses`
- ✅ Using GPT-4.1 model as specified
- ✅ Proper response parsing structure
- ✅ Support for conversation continuity with `previous_response_id`
- ⚠️ Tools defined but not fully configured
- ❌ Not using advanced features (streaming, structured outputs)

### Optimization Opportunities
1. Enable `store: true` for all responses to build conversation history
2. Use `include` parameter to get additional output data
3. Implement structured outputs for consistent data extraction
4. Add web search tool for real-time company data
5. Use file search for knowledge base queries

## Technical Architecture

### API Flow
1. Next.js API routes proxy to Supabase Edge Functions
