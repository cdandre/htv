# HTV VC Operating System - Executive Summary & Implementation Guide

## Project Overview

Home Technology Ventures (HTV) is building a comprehensive venture capital operating system to automate deal screening, memo generation, and portfolio management. This system will save 10+ hours per investment memo and enable faster, data-driven investment decisions.

**Timeline**: 12-16 weeks for MVP
**Tech Stack**: Next.js/Vercel + Supabase + OpenAI Responses API (GPT-4.1)
**Priority**: Deal Screener & Memo Generator modules first

## Key Insights from Koby's Requirements

Based on the conversation transcript, the most critical needs are:

1. **Quick Deal Filtering** - "throw out the trash quicker"
2. **Automated Memo Generation** - Currently takes 10+ hours
3. **Three Data Types Integration**:
   - Industry content (50+ newsletters)
   - Proprietary deal data
   - Market map of all startups
4. **Workflow Automation**: Thesis → Signals → Validation → Investment
5. **Meeting Transcription** - Integrate conversation insights

The system should follow HTV's investment workflow chronologically, pre-writing memo sections as deals progress through stages.
