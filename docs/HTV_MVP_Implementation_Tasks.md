# HTV Venture Capital Operating System - MVP Implementation Tasks

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive implementation plan for HTV's VC Operating System MVP, focusing on delivering maximum value through automated deal analysis and memo generation. The system leverages Supabase for backend infrastructure, Vercel for frontend hosting, and OpenAI GPT-4.1 for AI-powered analysis.

**MVP Goal**: Build a functional system that can ingest deal documents, analyze startups automatically, generate investment memos, and track deals through a pipeline - reducing analyst work from days to hours.

**Tech Stack**: Next.js/React (Vercel) + Supabase + OpenAI GPT-4.1
