### **Project Summary**

Home Technology Ventures is building a vertically integrated venture capital operating system that streamlines sourcing underwriting, investment decision-making, portfolio management, and content generation. The platform will function as a modular intelligence suite tailored specifically for our firm's workflows and thesis-driven investment strategy in the housing innovation ecosystem.

This Scope of Work outlines the specifications and core deliverables for six interconnected modules. Each module is expected to integrate with the others through a unified backend and intuitive front-end experience.
